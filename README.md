# PA-4 DATA WRANGLING AND DATA VISUALIZATION

To identify the codes and functions needed in cleaning and visualizing data.

To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program 
that will be used in data wrangling and data visualization.

# ECE Board Exam Problem

- Using data wrangling and data visualization technique with storytelling, analyze the
  data and present different (i) data frames; and (ii) visuals using the dataset given.

- Produce an output which shows the Math scores that are lower than 70 by the examinees from Visayas.

- Produce an output which shows the Electronics scores that are greater than 70, and also the GEAS scores
  by the examinees who are under the Instrumentation track from Luzon.

- Produce an output which shows the Electronics scores of those who has an average score that is greater
  than 55 by the female examinees from Mindanao.

- To create a visualization that shows how the different features contributes to average grade and to answer
  if the chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contributes to a higher average score.


# Getting Started

  - Jupyter Notebook

  - Anaconda Navigator

  - Coding device (laptops, pc, etc.)

  - Downloaded board2.csv file

# Execution of the Program

- On the  very first cell, it is crucial to input "import pandas as pd" in order for the program to run.

- Include "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt" in order for the program to show a graph.

- Allow the program to read the board2.csv file by inputting this too in the first cell
